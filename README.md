Dont get eaten by whale pls. Especially the big ones, not nice really. This mod contains a load of overpowered and broken civs. If you run em against former civs off the game, these civs will dominate. All in all I think the civs are pretty balanced against each other. Besiddes that the civ "The Forgotten" is, I think pretty broken these days, as well as the civ "Dragon Cliffs". The balance team is willing to make changes(joke), to make things more balanced.(A joke really imma just add another bunch of civs, that are even more unbalanced).
