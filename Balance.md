12.02.2023-The Forgotten got nerfed, as their hero summoning now lowers their military production, which makes it harder for them to build a really overpowered army, and gives their heros a more important stand in this civ.

12.02.2023-The Forgotten can now buy their Heros with faith at an increasing price. So they dont loose their benefits if they loose a hero early.

12.02.2023-Igloo gets buffed, cause it was quite useless before.
